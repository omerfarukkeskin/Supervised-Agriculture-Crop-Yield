# Supervised-Agriculture-Crop-Yield

This project aims to create a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict the yield of agricultural products. The dataset used contains information for estimating crop yield per hectare (Yield_tons_per_hectare) based on various factors.

Multiple Linear Regression was chosen to model the linear relationship between the dependent variable, yield per hectare (Yield_tons_per_hectare), and multiple independent variables (such as soil type, rainfall, temperature, etc.). To evaluate the accuracy of this model, metrics like R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were used. The low error values provided by these metrics indicate that the model performs well and is suitable for predicting yield.

The columns in the dataset are:

Soil_Type: Soil Type

Crop: Crop Planted

Rainfall_mm: Amount of Rainfall (mm)

Temperature_Celsius: Temperature (°C)

Fertilizer_Used: Amount of Fertilizer Used

Irrigation_Used: Irrigation Amount

Weather_Condition: Weather

Days_to_Harvest: Number of Days Until Harvest

Yield_tons_per_hectare: Crop Yield per Hectare (Dependent Variable)

Within the scope of the project, Multiple Linear Regression was used to model the relationship between the dependent variable of yield per hectare (Yield_tons_per_hectare) and other columns (independent variables). The model predicts yield based on factors such as soil type, temperature, and rainfall.
